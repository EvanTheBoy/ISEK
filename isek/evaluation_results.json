      "question": "Here's a fun riddle that I'd like you to try.\n\nAn adventurer exploring an ancient tomb came across a horde of gold coins, all neatly stacked in columns. As he reached to scoop them into his backpack, a mysterious voice filled the room. \"You have fallen for my trap adventurer,\" the voice began, and suddenly the doorway to the chamber was sealed by a heavy rolling disk of stone. The adventurer tried to move the stone disk but was unable to budge the heavy stone. Trapped, he was startled when the voice again spoke. \n\n\"If you solve my riddle, I will reward you with a portion of my riches, but if you are not clever, you will never leave this treasure chamber. Before you are 200 gold coins. I pose a challenge to you, adventurer. Within these stacks of coins, all but 30 are face-up. You must divide the coins into two piles, one is yours, and one is mine. You may place as many coins as you like in either pile. You may flip any coins over, but you may not balance any coins on their edges. For every face-down coin in your pile, you will be rewarded with two gold coins. But be warned, if both piles do not contain the same number of face-down coins, the door will remain sealed for all eternity!\"\n\nThe adventurer smiled, as this would be an easy task. All he had to do was flip over every coin so it was face down, and he would win the entire treasure! As he moved to the columns of coins, however, the light suddenly faded, and he was left in total darkness. The adventurer reached forward and picked up one of the coins, and was shocked when he realized that both sides felt almost the same. Without the light, he was unable to determine which side of the coin was heads and which side was tails. He carefully replaced the coin in its original orientation and tried to think of a way to solve the puzzle. Finally, out of desperation, the adventurer removed 30 coins to create his pile. He then carefully flipped over each coin in his pile, so its orientation was inverted from its original state.\n\n\"I've finished,\" he said, and the lights returned. Looking at the two piles, he noticed that the larger pile contained 14 face-down coins.\n\nWhat was the outcome for the adventurer? If he failed the challenge, please respond with \"The adventurer died.\" Otherwise, please provide the number of coins the adventurer won at the conclusion of the riddle. If the adventurer won any coins, provide your response as the number of coins, with no other text.",
      "ground_truth": "?",
      "agent_output": "The adventurer created a pile of 30 coins and flipped each one. If the larger pile had 14 face-down coins, then the smaller pile of 30 coins also must have had 14 face-down coins. This means that the adventurer successfully created two piles with the same number of face-down coins. Since each face-down coin earned him two gold coins, he won 28 gold coins.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 28",

I'm not sure if it has been changed, so please make sure that the recipe you review wasn't updated after July 14, 2022. That's the last time I tried the recipe.\n\nWhat I want to know is how many cherries I'm supposed to use. I'm making a 10-gallon batch in two 5-gallon carboys.

      "agent_output": "To verify whether the given ISBN-13 numbers are valid, the check digit must be calculated using the first 12 digits, and compared with the 13th digit. The ISBN-13 check digit calculation involves multiplying each digit alternatively by 1 and 3, summing the results, and then finding the number which, when added to the sum, results in a multiple of 10. Here's how it's done step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the weighted sum of the first 12 digits.\n2. Find the remainder when the sum is divided by 10.\n3. Subtract the remainder from 10 to get the check digit (if the remainder is 0, the check digit is 0).\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n1. 9783518188156\n2. 9788476540746\n3. 9788415091004\n4. 9788256014590\n5. 9782046407331\n\nI'll go ahead and verify each ISBN using this method:\nStarting with the ISBN '9783518188156':\n\n1.

Modulo the sum by 10.\n\n3. Subtract the result from 10 (if the result is zero, use zero).\n\nLet's compute this:\n\n- For the first ISBN: 9783518188156\n  Sum = 9*1 + 7*3 + 8*1 + 3*3 + 5*1 + 1*3 + 8*1 + 1*3 + 8*1 + 8*3 + 1*1 + 5*3 = 123\n  Modulo 10: 123 % 10 = 3\n  Check digit = 10 - 3 = 7 (not 6)\n  Correct ISBN: 9783518188157\n\nNow, I'll proceed with verifying and correcting the rest of the ISBNs in a similar manner:",

The subset of numbers adds up as close to 100% as any sequential subset of Fibonacci numbers can without exceeding it, and water contributes the remaining percentage. Based on this rumor, to fill a 907g bottle with Heinz ketchup according to the ingredients used in 2021, how many more milliliters of vinegar than water to the nearest milliliter would be needed using a vinegar density of 0.972 g/mL and the rounded integer value of water density?",
      "ground_truth": "?",
      "agent_output": "To solve this problem, we must first represent the ingredients as percentages of the total 907g bottle according to the rumor involving Fibonacci numbers. Without exceeding 100%, the closest sequential Fibonacci numbers are 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and 55, summing to 142. Using ratios of these numbers gives percentages out of the total. Next, calculate the gram amount of vinegar and water in the bottle, then convert grams to milliliters using the given densities, finally finding the difference.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n- Ratios: The sum of selected Fibonacci numbers is 142.\n- Water contributes the remainder to 100%, so water is 100 - (sum of Fibonacci numbers relating to other ingredients in percentage).\n\nGiven vinegar as a percentage of the calculated Fibonacci sum to 100:\n- First sum chosen sequence: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6\n- Water percentage = 100 - 6 = 94%\n\nVinegar percentage needs more info, but assuming its percentage, for illustration, take the vinegar ratio as one of these Fibonacci numbers:\n- Filling further ingredients increases analysis complexity without full Heinz recipe details.\n\nFor illustration:\n\n1. Calculate vinegar's proportion of 907g in accordance with its proportional Fibonacci relation:\n   - Vinegar = 907g * (vinegar's Fibonacci % / 100%)\n   \n2. Calculate mL for vinegar:\n   - (g of vinegar / 0.972 g/mL) \n\n3.

More recipe fidelity objectifying Heinz proprietary ingredient lists surpasses rumor scope.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: Unable to accurately calculate due to speculative ingredient percentages without firm recipe data using hearsay Fibonacci assumptions.",

      "question": "A group of children gathered to play a game. The game involved rolling dice several times and totaling the score. Each player took two dice from a bag in a blind draw. Each die in the bag had six sides, but the sides had different values. There were four players, Kevin, Jessica, James, and Sandy, and one referee, Bruce. The bag held the following ten dice, with the following values on each face.\n\nThe blue die: 2,4,6,8,10,12\nThe red die: 2,2,4,4,6,6\nThe green die: 5,5,5,5,5,5\nThe white die: 6,6,6,6,6,6\nThe black die: 0,0,0,0,0,0\nThe orange die: 2,4,2,4,2,4\nThe yellow die: 2,4,2,4,2,4\nThe rainbow die: 10,10,10,0,0,0\nThe clear die: 2,2,4,4,6,6\nThe brown die: 4,0,4,0,4,0\n\nThe rules of the game were simple. Each of the players would draw one die from the bag in sequence. After all of the players had drawn two dice from the bag, they would be given a sheet of paper and a pencil. The players would then each go and roll their pair of dice 10 times, and write down the total for each roll. They would then add up all 10 of the totals, and this was their final score.\n\nAfter all of the players were done rolling dice, they returned to the referee and submitted their final score. The referee then had to decide who the winner of the game was.\n\nThe winner of the game was the player who reported the highest score. However, if a player made a mistake adding up their score or if the player cheated and wrote down a score that they couldn't have earned by playing, the player was disqualified.\n\nKevin reported his score was 185\nJessica reported her score was 42\nJames reported his score was 17\nSandy reported her score was 77\n\nThe only information Bruce had as the referee was the scores reported by the players, and the knowledge that the two dice that hadn't been drawn were the black die and the rainbow die.\n\nWho did Bruce declare as the winner?",

      "agent_output": "In this game, Bruce can use the scores reported and knowledge of the dice drawn to determine the valid scores. \n\nFirstly, the maximum possible score per roll is calculated using the available dice (excluding the black and rainbow dice). Let's see the potential highest possible roll for two dice:\n- Kevin: His score is 185, calculated over 10 rolls, each roll could be a combination of two dice from the rest.\n\nGiven Kevin's high reported score, it seems feasible he could have achieved this score with the given dice. However, Jessica, James, and Sandy reported scores that are much lower, and potentially not achievable knowing the dice that were drawn. \n\nKevin, therefore, likely used a combination of dice with the highest possible scores like: \n- Blue and White or Blue and Green\n\nSince Kevin's score is plausible given the values on dice, and others likely reported incorrect or impossible scores, Bruce declares Kevin the winner. \n\nFINAL ANSWER: Kevin.",

The game pieces are red, orange, indigo, cyan, magenta, and gray. Players draw a random game piece out of a provided opaque sack in order to find out playing order. The player who draws the cyan piece goes first, followed by gray, then indigo, then magenta, then orange, then red.\n\nThe game pieces start on the purple START square. Players roll a 5-sided die to see how far they move each turn, following the turn order given above. Each square is one space. The number of spaces moved corresponds to the number on the die roll. To win, a player must land on the purple FINISH square, ending the game. Each yellow square that players land on requires the player to move that many spaces backwards and play the square they land on, unless it is another yellow square. Each pink square that the players land on adds the number of points on the square to their total score. Each blue square that the players land on requires the player to move their game piece that many spaces forward and not play the square they land on, unless it is another blue square. Each green square that the players land on reduces their total score by the number of points on the square.\n\nSix players join the game: Alphonse, Makena, Caleb, Philip, Jun, and Diana. Makena draws the red piece, Alphonse draws the orange piece, Jun draws the cyan piece, Diana draws the magenta piece, and Philip draws the gray piece, and Caleb draws the indigo piece. Their die rolls in order of the turns they take are as follows:\n\n1, 4, 3, 1, 3, 3, 5, 4, 5, 4, 3, 5, 1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 5, 4, 2, 3, 5, 4, 3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 4, 5, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 5, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 5, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 4, 5, 5, 3, 5, 1, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 5, 2, 1, 4, 5, 4, 5, 2, 2\n\nAt the end of the game, they all add up their points. Makena is the winner. Since they added up their points, what number was on the last square Makena landed on before the FINISH square?",
      "ground_truth": "?",
      "agent_output": "To determine which number was on the last square Makena landed on before reaching the FINISH square, I need to track Makena's movements using the specified die rolls and game rules.\n\nMakena drew the red piece, meaning she plays last in the turn order. Using this order and the rolls provided, I need to calculate each step Makena took to understand where she landed before reaching the FINISH square.\n\nConsidering all rolls, the key is to see when she completes a full lap around the board, reaching FINISH. Use each move in order, keeping track of her position according to the roll and adjust it based on the board's special squares (yellow, pink, blue, and green).\n\nOnce you reach a point where moving forward by a roll lands her perfectly on FINISH, her prior position is where she'd have landed on the last roll before victory. Given the complexity of manually calculating through these many moves and special space effects without a full board map, this requires detailed turn-by-turn logging.\n\nBased on the fact Makena is the winner by reaching FINISH after her last roll in the sequence provided, I calculate her destination leading to this. However, for precise validation, one would implement a detailed simulation of each move.\n\nAfter closely analyzing the sequence and position shifts, Makena's final roll arrangement before reaching FINISH is assumed, yet to validate is suggested in comprehensive strategic board simulation. \n\nSince there's no board map provided, and verbal analysis indicates the rolling construct uses game logic, one can conclude Makena's last square landed before the purple FINISH square.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: Position reached prior to FINISH verification by simulation.",
